# Google-App-Script-Send-auto-response-to-email
This Google Apps Script automates the process of sending a response email to access requests received in Gmail. It specifically targets unread email threads from a specific sender (`drive-shares-dm-noreply@google.com`) with a subject line indicating a request for access to a presentation (`Share request for`).
